Monospace terminal fonts for text and coding.

Based on the freedesktop X11 fixed family of fonts (font-misc-misc) with some
influences taken from Proggy fonts (http://www.proggyfonts.com).

Design goals:
- Readable, general purpose, usable for code, text, and command-line.
- Three sizes: 6x10 (small), 7x13 (medium), 10x20 (huge).
- Include as many unicode points as available (up to FFFF).
- Coplete bold * italic variants.

The variants only include code points that differ from the base, so it's best
to use these with a terminal that can fall back to the plain version.  I use
them with xtmux which will behave correctly using:
> set xtmux-font "-dylex-terminal-medium-r-*-*-13-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"

Also included is a square 14x14 font designed for crawl and other rogue-likes.
